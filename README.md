# AI Financial Research Agent System

A sophisticated multi-agent AI system designed for comprehensive financial research and analysis. This system orchestrates specialized AI agents to perform parallel research, analysis, and report generation with real-time progress tracking and quality verification.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Pattern

The system follows a **distributed agent architecture** where specialized AI agents collaborate to complete complex research tasks:

```
User Query ‚Üí Planner Agent ‚Üí Search Agents (Parallel) ‚Üí Analysis Agents ‚Üí Writer Agent ‚Üí Verifier Agent ‚Üí Final Report
```

### Core Components

| Component | Role | Technology | Model |
|-----------|------|------------|-------|
| **Planner Agent** | Research strategy & query decomposition | OpenAI o3-mini | Strategic planning |
| **Search Agent** | Web research & data collection | OpenAI gpt-4.1 + WebSearchTool | Information retrieval |
| **Financial Agent** | Market analysis & opportunities | OpenAI gpt-4.1 | Financial expertise |
| **Risk Agent** | Risk assessment & threat analysis | OpenAI gpt-4.1 | Risk management |
| **Writer Agent** | Report synthesis & generation | OpenAI gpt-4.1 | Content creation |
| **Verifier Agent** | Quality assurance & validation | OpenAI gpt-4o | Quality control |

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Asynchronous Processing Pipeline

```python
# Parallel search execution
tasks = [asyncio.create_task(self._search(item)) for item in search_plan.searches]
results: list[str] = []
for task in asyncio.as_completed(tasks):
    result = await task
    if result is not None:
        results.append(result)
```

### Agent Framework Integration

The system leverages a custom agent framework with the following capabilities:

- **Tool Integration**: Agents can call external tools (web search, other agents)
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time progress updates and streaming responses
- **Custom Output Extractors**: Specialized data transformation between agents
- **Model Configuration**: Per-agent model selection and settings

### Data Models & Type Safety

All data structures use **Pydantic** for validation and type safety:

```python
class FinancialReportData(BaseModel):
    short_summary: str
    """A short 2‚Äë3 sentence executive summary."""
    markdown_report: str
    """The full markdown report."""
    follow_up_questions: list[str]
    """Suggested follow‚Äëup questions for further research."""

class VerificationResult(BaseModel):
    verified: bool
    """Whether the report seems coherent and plausible."""
    issues: str
    """If not verified, describe the main issues or concerns."""
```

### Observability & Monitoring
